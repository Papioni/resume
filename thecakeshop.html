    <hr>
    <p>
       Cake is a form of sweet food made from flour, sugar, and other <br>
     ingredients, that is usually baked. In their oldest forms, cakes <br>
     were modifications of bread, but cakes now cover a wide range of <br>
     preparations that can be simple or elaborate, and that share features<br>
      with other desserts such as pastries, meringues, custards, and pies.<br>
The most commonly used cake ingredients include flour, sugar, eggs,<br>
     butter or oil or margarine, a liquid, and a leavening agent, such <br>
     as baking soda or baking powder. Common additional ingredients and <br>
     flavourings include dried, candied, or fresh fruit, nuts, cocoa, and <br>
     extracts such as vanilla, with numerous substitutions for the primary <br> 
     ingredients. Cakes can also be filled with fruit preserves, nuts or <br>
     dessert sauces (like pastry cream), iced with buttercream or other<br>
    icings, and decorated with marzipan, piped borders, or candied fruit.<br>

    
    Cake is often served as a celebratory dish on ceremonial occasions, <br>
    such as weddings, anniversaries, and birthdays. There are countless cake<br>
      recipes; some are bread-like, some are rich and elaborate, and many<br>
       are centuries old. Cake making is no longer a complicated procedure;<br>
        while at one time considerable labor went into cake making <br>
        (particularly the whisking of egg foams), baking equipment and <br>
        directions have been simplified so that even the most amateur of cooks<br>
         may bake a cake. </p>
